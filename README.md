Repository containing data model and functionality connected to dialogues between NAV and their end-users. This package exposes a custom rest API for consumers to submit and retrieve inquiry(henvendels) information to and from Salesforce.

## 1. Core objects

The package consists of three custom objects, Thread**c and Message**c and Conversation_Note**c. Thread and message are made to model a threaded dialogue similar to i.e slack, teams etc. Conversation_Note**c models a written note summary from NAV to summarize either a phone- or physical meeting.

### 1.1 Thread model

## 2. Access and permissions

Baseline access to functionality in regards to the core is covered in the Messaging_Read_and_Write_Messages_and_Threads permission set. Additionally the Messaging_Quicktext and Redaction_Permission_Set grants access for internal users to user i.e. quick texts in the standard components.

## 3. Core components

The frontend functionality is delivered by a set og LWC that can be exposed [externally](force-app/main/default/core-functionality/external-components/.doc/) and [internally](force-app/main/default/core-functionality/internal-components/.doc/)

## 3. Guidelines

When implementing use of this package there are some important guidelines to follow to keep process automation specific for <strong>your</strong> usecase.

1. You should always define a new thread type for a different process. This means one or more new values should be added to the CRM_Thread_Type\_\_c field. Keep in mind that the amount of data in the tables are way over the LDV limit meaning you should always optimize your queries using indexed fields. For this purpose the <strong>CRM_Type\_\_c</strong> har been created and indexed on the thread object (This is populated in a flow for ALL thread types and copies the CRM_Thread_Type\_\_c value)
2. Be extremely careful when implementing validation rules to ensure these do ONLY trigger for your process' thread type
3. Please contact #crm-platform-team on slack if you require i.e. new message type or event types for to ensure this keeps the core functionality intact.
4. As of now the API defined in RestServices is tightly connected to STO/STB flow so please contact the team if there is need to restructure the API for more generic thread type handling (should be fairly easy to implement)
5. For journal and archive requirements a discussion is needed as currently the document template is a bit tightly connected to the STO solution and would need minor rework.

## 4. Dependencies

1. Run `npm install` from the project root folder
1. Install [SSDX](https://github.com/navikt/ssdx)
    - **Non-developers may stop after this step**
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (recommended)
    - Install [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode)
    - **Install recommended plugins!** A notification should appear when opening VS Code. It will prompt you to install recommended plugins.

## 6. Build

To build locally without using SSDX, do the following:

1. If you haven't authenticated a DX user to production / DevHub, run `sfdx auth:web:login -d -a production` and log in
    - Ask `#crm-platform-team` on Slack if you don't have a user
    - If you change from one repo to another, you can change the default DevHub username in `.sfdx/sfdx-config.json`, but you can also just run the command above
1. Create a scratch org, install dependencies and push metadata:

```bash
sfdx force:org:create -f ./config/project-scratch-def.json --setalias scratch_org --durationdays 1 --setdefaultusername
echo y | sfdx plugins:install sfpowerkit@2.0.1
keys="" && for p in $(sfdx force:package:list --json | jq '.result | .[].Name' -r); do keys+=$p":navcrm "; done
sfdx sfpowerkit:package:dependencies:install -u scratch_org -r -a -w 60 -k ${keys}
sfdx force:source:push
sfdx force:org:open
```
